# Architecture Challenge

We’re planning for the next 12 months of growth, expecting a **10x increase in SME funding applications** flowing through our Node.js + TypeScript + PostgreSQL backend. Right now, the monolithic service that handles disbursement requests and AI‑driven risk scoring is **showing signs of performance bottlenecks** during peak traffic.

## System Architecture & Process

- Draft a **high-level architecture diagram or outline** for a **more scalable and resilient system**.
- Suggest **2–3 engineering process improvements** (planning, reviews, or releases) to improve **team velocity** without sacrificing code quality.
- Briefly **explain one trade-off** you’re making and why in a loom video that would be posted in the `architecture` slack channel of the company.

## Deliverables

- High-level architecture diagram (any format: draw.io, Lucidchart, hand-drawn + photo)
- 3-5 minute Loom video explaining the diagram and discussing at least one key trade-off

## Context & Constraints

Current system details:

- Single Node.js service handling both disbursements and risk scoring
- PostgreSQL database
- Team size: 16 engineers
