# In this task...

We have an image of a portfolio overview page. Your task is to break it down into components and create a React component structure for it. The components should be reusable and modular, allowing for easy updates and maintenance.

## You do not need to implement the components, just create the structure.

You can do this in anyway you like. If you are a visual person, you could draw it out on paper or use a tool like Figma. If you prefer text, you could write it out in a markdown file or in notion. If you prefer code, you could make some files but no implementation logic is required.

Please make sure to include the following:

- A clear hierarchy of components
- Reusable components
- Any necessary props or state management
- Any potential CSS or styling considerations
- Any api calls or data fetching that may be required and hence the apis you would need to create on the backend
- Any potential testing strategies or considerations
