# Breakdown UI Challenge

## The Image

**IMPORTANT:** View the portfolio overview mockup: `image.png` (in this folder)

We have an image of a portfolio overview page. Your task is to break it down into components and create a React component structure for it. The components should be reusable and modular, allowing for easy updates and maintenance.

## You do not need to implement the components, just create the structure.

## Task (20 minutes max)

Look at the image and create a simple component breakdown showing:

- What components you'd create
- How they connect to each other
- Which ones are reusable

## Deliverables

**Pick the easiest format for you:**

- Hand-drawn diagram + photo
- Simple text list in markdown
- Basic component names in code comments

**Plus:** 2-3 minute Loom explaining your thinking

- Your component hierarchy decisions
- Key reusability patterns you identified
- One trade-off you made and why

## Context: Portfolio Overview Page Features

The mockup shows:

- **Header:** Page title + search bar (filters all data)
- **KPI Section:** key metrics from backend
- **Portfolio Table:** Company list with columns:
  - Company name
  - Investment amount
  - Deal KPIs/metrics
  - Group classification (aggregated high-level values shown in group rows)
