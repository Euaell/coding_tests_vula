# In this task...

We have an image of a portfolio overview page. Your task is to break it down into components and create a React component structure for it. The components should be reusable and modular, allowing for easy updates and maintenance.

## You do not need to implement the components, just create the structure.

## Considerations

Consider the following areas when breaking down the components:

- A clear hierarchy of components
- Reusable components
- Any necessary props or state management
- Any potential CSS or styling considerations
- Any api calls or data fetching that may be required and hence the apis you would need to create on the backend
- Any potential testing strategies or considerations

# The output

Please provide a clear and concise (sub 5 minute) breakdown of the components and their structure. Please record a short video explaining your thinking and the structure you have created using Loom or another screen recording tool.

You can do breakdown the structure in anyway you like. If you are a visual person, use a tool like Figma. If you prefer text, you could write it out in a markdown file or in notion. If you prefer code, you could make create pseudo-code files but no implementation logic is required. All we are looking for is how you think about the structure of the components and how they relate to each other, how you think about separation of concerns and that you can explain your thinking clearly.

# Context

The image is of a portfolio overview page. It shows a list of portfolio companies of an organisation with made up data. The page shows the following information:

- A title
- A search functionality (which filters the entire page)
- A group of KPIs that come from the backend
- A list of portfolio companies with the following information:
  - The name of the company
  - The amount of money invested in the company
  - clear kpi's the deal is measuring
- Note that in the table, the group column has a high order value from the portfolio deals in that group.
